# SDSNN: Stress-Dependent Strength Neural Network (PINN-Based)

This repository contains the implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model named **SDSNN**, designed to predict rock strength under true triaxial stress conditions. The model integrates physical constraints into neural network training to enhance generalization and interpretability.
